CPU Schedulers Simulator – Operating Systems 

This project is a Java-based simulator for multiple CPU scheduling algorithms, including Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling with starvation prevention, and AG Scheduling. The simulator handles context switching, dynamic quantum updates, and process state transitions, and reports execution order, waiting time, turnaround time, and average metrics. Unit tests are included to validate correctness against provided test cases.
